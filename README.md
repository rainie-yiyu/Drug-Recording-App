## Diabetes App

**what will the application do?**
The application enables diabetes patients to keeps track of their drugplan and bloodsugar 
so that they can better manage the chronic disease.

**Who will use it?**
The diabetes patients.

**why this interests you?**
Because for chronic diseases like diabetes, the most important thing is to 
insist to take medicine and keep track of their blood sugar everyday. I want 
to creat an app that make some convenience for them to do those thing so that
they can better manage their disease.
